                        <p>Human Rights are entitlements that everyone has by virtue of being a human being, and that, based in the freedom, dignity and equality of the human persons, are recognized by the legal frameworks of the states, at the national or at the international levels. These rights are protected by the law and guaranteed by the State. Human Rights protect individuals and groups of individuals against actions that interfere with their fundamental freedoms and undermine their human dignity.</p>
                        <p>They are fundamental rights, to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being. They protect human dignity and integrity. They involve all elementary pre conditions for a dignified human existence.</p>
